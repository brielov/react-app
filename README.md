# react-app

This is my own `create-react-app`. The reason I made this repo is because `create-react-app` has missing features I need.

### Install

```bash
npx degit brielov/react-app my-app
```

### Features

- Similar folder structure as `create-react-app`
- TypeScript 4.2
- JSX Factories
- PostCSS 8
- TailwindCSS 2 (with JIT compiler, very fast)
- CSS Modules
- Webpack 5
- SWC instead of Babel (very fast)
- Jest
- SPA (with service worker)
- Husky hooks for ESLint, Prettier and Jest

### Missing features

- Fast refresh ([#588][588])
