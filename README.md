# react-app

This is my own `create-react-app`. The reason I made this repo is because `create-react-app` has missing features I need.

### Features

- Similar folder structure as `create-react-app`
- TypeScript 4.1
- PostCSS 8
- TailwindCSS 2
- CSS Modules
- Webpack 5
- SWC instead of Babel (very fast)
- Jest
- Husky hooks for ESLint, Prettier and Jest

### Missing features

- Fast refresh ([#588][588])
- JSX factories ([#1250][1250])

[1250]: https://github.com/swc-project/swc/issues/1250
